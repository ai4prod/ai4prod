## Ai4prod ðŸ‘‹

**Ai4prod is the first ecosystem built for offering an end-to-end solution to handle AI project for production environment in C++** 

  

**The core design Principles** of Ai4prod are:

  

- Easy **Integration**

- Easy **Customization**

- Works on **different Hardware** and operating system (Windows,Linux,Jetson)

- Make coding workflow standard for code **maintainability**

- C++ ready


**Ai4prod is built for**

  

- Newbie Machine learning engineer who feel lost about how to bring Ai project in production.

- Experienced Machine Learning Engineer who are looking for an easy way to use their **custom model with C++ in production**.

  
  
**Who developed Ai4prod?**

Ai4Prod is maintaned from a team of Machine Learning engineer that everyday is trying to bring and maintain Machine Learning project in production in C++

  

**Why Ai4Prod is different**?

Ai4prod if offering you the entire pipeline from training to inference. So learning how to use Ai4Prod gives you the ability to deliver real value with AI.

 
 Ai4prod is fully tested so you don't need to worry about code compatibiity between different library version. We handle all.

  
 We developed ai4prod with the idea to simplify the entire pipeline in a machine learning project. As a machine learning engineer we know that make something work in an Ai project is not simple.

We built ai4prod to help us to crete real value in a production environment, so we hope that could also help you.

Ai4prod is developed following our experience in production if you think that something is missing or could be helpfull drop us an email ai **info@ai4prod.ai** or open a thread on github.

We are always open to collaboration.

## Getting Started

  

Ai4prod is built to be as easy as possible to get started. You can reach our website at the following link https://www.ai4prod.ai/

We provide installation script to install all dependencies.

 ### Prerequisites
 1.  For both platforms you need to install cuda and cudnn IF you want to use GPU acceleration. If you are not familiar how to install we creata a guide https://www.ai4prod.ai/docs/error/tip-tricks/install-cuda-with-cuda-toolkit/
 2. You need to install CMake >3.13 to compile ai4prod. If you don't know how to do follow our guide https://www.ai4prod.ai/docs/getting-started/. Choose your operating system

### Install dependencies
We provide installer script for bot Windows and Linux

### STEP 1
#### Windows 

   `./installWin.bat --cuda 11.0`

####  Linux 

    ./install.sh --cuda 10.2 --cmake 
    

 - -- cmake is optional. Will install cmake 3.14 and override previous version

### STEP 2

Compile the project with Cmake

#### Linux 

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX= {your_install_folder} -DEXECUTION_PROVIDER=tensorrt|cpu -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
    $ make -j10
    $ make install
