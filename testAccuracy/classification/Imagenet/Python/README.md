# Test Accuracy


In this folder you can find python scripts that we used to verify the accuracy of the model trained in pytorch(-lighting) respect to our c++ version.
Result accuracy are important because wee need to verify if during conversion everything is good, in order to verify our pipeline.

# classifier_inference_lighting

Is used for create the detection accuracy for pytorch lighting model

#find accuracy 

Is used to compare detection from our model respect to imagenet labels

#convertImagenet-Label

File to converte imagenet label in more usable .csv form
